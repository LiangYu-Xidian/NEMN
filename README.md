# NEMN
 Network Embedding framework in Multiplex Networks
 
 Two applications for NEMN：
 DDI prediction. Data from [33]	Gottlieb A, Stein G Y, Oron Y, et al. INDI: a computational framework for inferring drug interactions and their associated recommendations[J]. Molecular Systems Biology, 2012, 8(1): 592.
 Drug combination. Data from DrugBank、SIDER et al.
 
 four Steps for NEMN:
  1、evluate network importance
  2、bias random walk for got path
  3、train Skip-gram model
  4、randomforest calssifier
 You can find NEMN in folder of Code.
 Data in Drug combination and Drug-Drug-Interaction.
